Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a data and analytics consultant at EY with a passion for utilizing Large Language Model, NLP, and AI to create automation solutions for companies. I am constantly expanding my knowledge and experience in these areas through reading articles and books, creating use cases and proof of concepts, and continuously teaching myself.

My proficiency in Python, SQL/MongoDB, and Azure, as well as my certification and familiarity with the Agile framework, make me a valuable asset to any team. I have already implemented multiple automation solutions for my company using LLM, and I am excited to explore more opportunities to utilize these technologies in the future.

Along with my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills such as communication, presentation, structured thinking, and problem-solving. These skills allow me to effectively collaborate with others and communicate complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner.
