<h1 align="left">About me üëã</h1>

###

<p align="left">My name is Adrien, a dedicated Software Engineer from Luxembourg, specializing in MLOps and data-intensive systems.</p>

###

<p align="left">
üöÄ As a <strong>Senior MLOps Engineer</strong>, I architect, build, and implement comprehensive MLOps platforms from the ground up, primarily for enterprise clients in the financial sector. My core focus is on enabling robust, scalable, and automated machine learning lifecycles ‚Äì from development and training through to deployment and monitoring in production.
<br><br>
Key areas of my MLOps expertise include:
<ul>
    <li>Designing cloud-agnostic infrastructure for AI model development and deployment (training & inference).</li>
    <li>Implementing automated provisioning of cloud resources and CI/CD pipelines for models and data.</li>
    <li>Integrating model registries (e.g., MLflow) and data versioning tools (e.g., DVC).</li>
    <li>Leveraging Kubernetes for scalable model deployment and developing custom gateways (Go) for enhanced security, monitoring, and load management.</li>
    <li>Optimizing data scientist workflows and managing on-premise GPU resources effectively.</li>
</ul>
My primary toolkit revolves around Python, Go, Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, DVC, and various cloud provider services.

<h2 align="left">Interests & Continuous Learning ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

<p align="left">
Beyond my professional MLOps work, I possess a strong intellectual curiosity for <strong>High-Performance Computing (HPC)</strong> and <strong>low-level systems programming</strong>. I am fascinated by the intricacies of how software interacts with hardware to achieve maximum efficiency.
<br><br>
This passion drives my current learning endeavors in:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zig:</strong> Exploring its potential for systems programming and performance-critical applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Deepening my understanding of manual and automatic memory allocation strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Parallel Computing:</strong> Actively studying frameworks like OpenCL, CUDA, and potentially OpenGL for GPGPU, to harness parallel processing power.</li>
    <li>Investigating compilers, assembly language, and hardware architecture to gain a foundational understanding of system performance.</li>
</ul>
My ultimate goal is to leverage this knowledge to build exceptionally performant and resilient software systems, potentially at the intersection of MLOps and HPC.

üéØ My ambition is to lead the design of cutting-edge MLOps solutions and contribute to complex, performance-critical open-source projects, ideally in a remote capacity.
<br>
üìÖ I am committed to daily coding and continuous learning through technical literature and community engagement.
<br>
üé≤ Fun fact: I can fall asleep in <1min every night.
